# Concatenated Number.py

# Problem description
# A list of integers num_list is given.
# Complete the solution function so that it returns the sum of the numbers concatenated in order of only the odd numbers in num_list and the numbers concatenated in order of only the even numbers.

# Restrictions
# 2 ≤ length of num_list ≤ 10
# 1 ≤ number of elements in num_list ≤ 9
# There is at least one even number and one odd number in num_list.

# Input/Output Example

# num_list          result
# [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]   393
# [5, 7, 8, 3]      581


# Input/Output Example Description
# Input/Output Example #1
# The number concatenated in order of only the odd numbers is 351 and the number concatenated in order of only the even numbers is 42.
# The sum of the two numbers is 393.

# Input/Output Example #2
# The number concatenated in order of only the odd numbers is 573 and the number concatenated in order of only the even numbers is 8.
# The sum of the two numbers is 581.
