# Merge larger.py

# Problem Description
# Operation ⊕ is an operation on two integers and returns the value written by concatenating the two integers.
# For example:

# 12 ⊕ 3 = 123
# 3 ⊕ 12 = 312
# Given positive integers a and b, please complete the solution function that returns the larger of a ⊕ b and b ⊕ a.

# However, if a ⊕ b and b ⊕ a are equal, a ⊕ b is returned.

# Restrictions
# 1 ≤ a, b < 10,000
# Input/output example
# a b result
# 9 91 991
# 89 8 898
# Input/Output Example Description
# Input/Output Example #1

# a ⊕ b = 991, and b ⊕ a = 919. The larger value of the two is 991, so 991 is returned.
# Input/Output Example #2

# a ⊕ b = 898, and b ⊕ a = 889. The larger value of the two is 898, so 898 is returned.
