# Product and Sum of Elements.py

# Submission details
# Problem description
# Given a list num_list containing integers, complete the solution function so that if the product of all elements is less than the sum square of all elements, it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.

# Restrictions
# 2 ≤ length of num_list ≤ 10
# 1 ≤ number of elements in num_list ≤ 9
# Input/output examples
# num_list         result
# [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]  1
# [5, 7, 8, 3]     0
# Input/output example description
# Input/output example #1

# Since the product of all elements is 120 and the sum square is 225, it returns 1.
# Input/output example #2

# Since the product of all elements is 840 and the sum square is 529, it returns 0.
